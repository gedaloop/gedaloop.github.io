I'm not ready yet to write about any of the articles I've read so far.
I'm not ready yet to write about a conversation with a coach.
I'm not ready yet to write about my plan.

But 2 lessons for today:
1) I should relax and take a break when and how I plan to relax and take a break. 
   Otherwise I'll relax and take a break when and how I really shouldn't, and I will feel bad about it.
2) I have to work even harder.

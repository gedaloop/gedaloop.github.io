Reading this article was the 3rd on my task list after paying the course enrolment fee and writing my first blog entry here. I simply started with this reading because this article is the first on the summer reading list of the course I'll start in September. I thought it'll be a nice way to dive into my studies. Turned out it was a fantastic choice!

It discusses the origins and the downsides of adding sugar coating to the term 'design thinking', and it critics the approaches that sell DT as the magic pill for every problem, especially around education. 
The reason is that in reality, not every popular product is successful, and not every solution is an innovation, just because one used the DT principles to get there. 

I personally can also get frustrated when an otherwise useful and interesting phenomenon gets hyped, goes viral and loses its soul - its original intent. That happens to something when you try to transform it to fit everyone's needs, but it’s not designed or destined to the ‘one size fits all’. In these cases, mass just creates mess. The more, the barrier.

I understood and rather agree with this article and its statement than not. 
When I started reading it, I still tried to look at the positive side of the coin that’s been stolen from the naive student’s pocket: empathy is important after all, so if these people sell this 'business 101' principle in a new fancy package, they don't necessarily cause such a big harm to humankind, do they? As long as it has some benefit to the world, we should be OK with hearing some businesses selling DT on every corner, no? 
But as I continued reading Lee Vinsel’s reasoning, my brain turned on again from the silly excuse-seeking for others. Do I really think this way? If I'm about to make design my world with full dedication, would I want someone to identify me with a hipster in a hoodie, carrying post-its? 

Honestly, I feel a little paranoia at this point, too. DT is just a simplification, so it can be marketed easier. And if something is marketed easily and is popular, everyone wants to do business with it, and so the word is spread, the hype is on. And when we are buying something based on a hype, and we don’t get what was featured in the ad, we can only blame ourselves.

I am actually a future design student, a.k.a. customer of the school I’ve just thrown a big chunk of money at to participate in a non-traditional course that has the word ‘design’ in it. Does this qualify me to be one of the “unpromising students who couldn’t hack it in traditional architecture or design programs”? Shall I run if I see a post-it? I wonder what other ‘marzipan cake expressions’ are out there that I should be beware of? Human-centered design? Multidisciplinary? Multipotential? Complexity? Innovation? Disruptive? Authentic? And new hot-air balloon buzzwords that may come into our lives should we avoid grabbing onto? Traditionalization? Certainability? Deordinarization? Potentiology? Decomplexation? Commonsensology?

Getting back to the paranoia, it’s indeed not an easy case. The principle behind calling people ‘Designers’ after completion of a masters in DT to make certain schools or departments more marketable for new generations does seem very similar to what happened to ‘Economists’ or to ‘Communication Managers’.

As a not-even-a-design-student, it would be hard for me to define who are the ‘real’, professional designers in 2018, but I also relate them to traditional design schools. Does this make me a fake traditionalist, who now applied to a non-traditional architecture school, who markets itself as ‘Institute of Advanced Architecture’? No, it doesn’t. Because I won’t consider myself as a designer, but someone who 1) studies at a design program 2) hopes to be able to work with professional designers at some point of my new career.

What will happen if non-designers start to market themselves as designers after learning design thinking? Reality will hopefully bite them in the long-term, together with their employers. It mostly does. Respect, evolution and persistence is the key. Aren’t we all what we do and succeed in, every day, consistently, long term?

Currently I work at a project management office. I know some PM techniques, and I manage projects, just like everyone else in their lives. Someone praised me for project management on LinkedIn. Hurray, but does any of these make me a PM? 
It all depends on the point of view. 
The design thinking courses could be called e.g. ‘Circumstances Improvement Techniques’ course and we could all chill and get back to work. But they are not, because nobody would pay 12,600 dollars for a 4-day boot camp in CIT. Blame it all on the marketing. (Hmmm, ‘marketing’ – another false friend.) Marketing can cause harm, just as everything that is self-centred and profit-oriented. Let’s not cry over the fact that there’s no moral in business. Buyers of new products, services and human resources should keep in mind that just because the name sounds good or has ‘agile’ before the title, or the topic was featured on TED, or is best selling on Amazon, it’s not necessarily innovative or better.

I enjoyed this article so much, especially the fact that is was recommended by the design program I’m about to start. It made me think a lot about what is design, why is it exclusive, where are the borders and who defines them – who decides if a project has anything to it as design or not? 
<i>“Design is the collection pot of aesthetics, form, functionality and innovation of anything that translates the changes, needs and thoughts of society and defines the quality of life.” It promises so much! So according to this definition, can’t design be a melting pot of different people practicing the above, even if not always successfully?</i>

The problem with design thinking is the word ‘design’ in it, as it’s not really about design. And if I want to go further, the problem is the word ‘design’. It’s way too wide of a concept. Why on earth are we extensively globalizing and at the same time, stereotyping titles that we can all hold after a 4-day course at this age of time, and especially when some would need exclusivity? Sometimes I introduce myself as ‘communication specialist’ just to get over it and still sound fancy. Who and what defines and approves my title, in case of such a vague professional area? And if so, communication of WHAT? Ironic that nobody has ever asked me back. Another example of shallow job title (mis)interpretations is of the abbreviation ‘Dr.’ in front of the names when someone has a doctorate. Doctor. What doctor? My Dad has a doctorate in Agriculture. He is an Ethologist, specialized in newborn pigs. When he gets pulled over by the police, they automatically assume that he can cure people, or minimum he can cure kittens. The only thing that may confuse them is the cheap car he’s driving.

For now, all I know is that I want to get into the world of designers. It won’t make me a designer, as a management school won’t make me a manager. I want to work with defining ideas that have the potential to change lives for the better. Because of the exclusivity of the design world, I feel that I must go to school and I must make connections there, and I must learn new tools and those technologies around which possibly new industries will born. Because of the exceptional infrastructure and good marketing of the school, and because it welcomes me even as a non-designer, I have chosen this course.
 
I'm closing this way-too-long post with a fav quote from this article:

<i>“It’s ironic because significant changes in art, technology, science, and all culture starts by building on what has come before, not by throwing it away. In jazz, for instance, Bird, Coltrane, and Herbie Hancock all spent years understanding the tradition — thousands of hours of listening and practice — before making their own musical breakthroughs. The best and deepest thinking always involves a dialectic between us and those who came before us, feeling our way forward together, forever imperfectly, towards truth. This is also why great teaching is always both a subversive and a conservative act, and why one of the foundational liberal arts is called love of wisdom.”</i>

title: The Plan
---

This week I was pretty much working on THE PLAN for the next 6 months - the time I have before the course starts.

I have started to look at the items on the summer reading list and read the first article there,
"Design Thinking is Kind of Like Syphilis — It’s Contagious and Rots Your Brains". (I will write about it next week.)

The next reads are the "Fab City Whitepaper" and the "Fab City Prototypes — Designing and making for the real world" - both should be 
read by Monday according to this wonderful plan of mine...we'll see how reality treats me during the weekend.

I have also started decluttering at home. As I'll be welcoming so many new experiences in my life, 
I don't want all the unnecessary, old stuff to hold my thoughts back. The easiest is the wardrobe: it's a seasonal change now, 
so I started there.

Just as planned, I also wrote to the school some questions I listed during the week, around the diploma and the laptop.

It's not in the plan particularly, but I'm also trying to work out a routine, and make it a habit by September. It includes a morning
and an evening routine, during the time my baby is asleep. As a first step, I did a very short morning yoga today, which felt great,
so I see a good chance that it'll stick.

That's it for today, the more intellectual part of the blog should start on Monday, with some article reviews.

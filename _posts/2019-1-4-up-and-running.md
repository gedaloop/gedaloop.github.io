title: You're up and running!

Today, I do feel up and running. 

I want to use this blog to document my journey of fighting demons and completing my goals, and to help me define who I am becoming while on the way. I paid the enrolment fee for a masters course today. The journey has officially started. There is no way I'm pulling myself out of this now. I am currently writing the roadmap for the next 6 months, the period that is left to start the course. So many things to do: to prepare myself, mainly. I will be posting every Monday and Friday about this 6 months.

Thank you barryclark for enabling me to set up a blog like this in no time.
